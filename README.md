Solution to the elevator project in TTK4145. The solution is built on a peer-to-peer topology, where assignments are distrubited through a hall_request_assigner executable file avaiable here: https://github.com/TTK4145/Project-resources/releases/tag/v1.1.1. This file is to be placed in the "cmd" folder. To run the program, first start the elevator server through the command "elevatorserver" in the terminal. Then, on n different computers, run the command "go run main.go port" where "port" is to be replaced with the port number that each elevator will use for communication between the primary and the backup processes. It is important that you run the command with different port numbers on different computers, to ensure the backup processes only listens for heartbeats from the primary processes on their own computers.
